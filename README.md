The DocentEDU Website - Powered by Jekyll

- The plan is to replace WordPress with Jekyll.
- Editing content and writing blog posts would then happen on GitHub.
- Would be much faster and more stable.
- Would take less disk space too.

Webhook is working, prototyping with Node.js
- Can run as user with appropriate permissions to move files around
