title: "New Feature: Google Classroom Roster Sync"

Part 2 of our Google Classroom update! It's a bit weird calling this a new feature, since all the syncing happens in the background and there isn't anything to see or do. However, this update will make your life easier, and isn't that what features are really about?

Here's how it works. Say you import a class from Google Classroom and share a docent to it. Then a new student joins your class on Google Classroom. After clicking the link to the DocentEDU assignment and signing in, she'll be automatically enrolled in the proper class and the docent will load just as you would expect. And that's all there is to it.

See you again in about 2 weeks when we release part three of our Classroom update, syncing grades.
