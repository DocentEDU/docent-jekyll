Today, I'm excited to announce a feature that's been a long time coming: viewing student annotations. A lot of teachers have requested this feature, and we've really wanted to make it. We just couldn't figure out a good UI for it.

Well, we finally have.

If you're viewing a docent and your student have made annotations, your screen will look like this:

<img width="400" src="https://docentedu.com/images/student-annotations-1.png" />

Click on that button on the top left and it will expand like this:

And now you can choose which student's annotations you want to view.
