Today, I'm excited to announce a feature that's been a long time coming: viewing student annotations. A lot of teachers have requested this feature, and we've really wanted to make it. We just couldn't figure out a good UI for it.

Well, we finally have.

If you're viewing a docent and your student have made annotations, you'll see this button <img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="https://docentedu.com/images/view-student-annotations.png" height="44" /> at the top left of your screen. If you click on that button, it will expand into a drop-down where you can select a student to view her annotations.
