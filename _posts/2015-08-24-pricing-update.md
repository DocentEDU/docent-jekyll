Can you feel the palpable excitement? We sure can here at DocentEDU. We are so excited about the new 2015-2016 school year. We’ve heard so many wonderful plans from our users this summer and we’re excited to be a part of so many classrooms this year.

We here at DocentEDU pride ourselves in being responsive. Since we were founded by two full-time teachers, we know how important it is for a tool to be there for you. And by that we mean customer service, troubleshooting, professional development, and feature development. This is what we’ve focused on, and want to continue focusing on in the future. 

Due to our commitment to be a constantly evolving product which is responsive to user needs, we’re announcing that DocentEDU will now be charging $40 per year, per teacher, or $8 per month. This will include an unlimited number of docents, and an unlimited number of students. Everyone gets a free trial, where you can make 5 docents on us, no charge. And don’t worry, anything you’ve created up until this point will still be around. You’ll still have access to all the features and aspects of DocentEDU within those 5 free docents.

This change will take full effect October 1st.  As a thank you to our current users you can subscribe before that with a 20% discount.

DocentEDU is a tool which allows you, the great educators who are our users, to create amazing and engaging lessons to teach your students great things. We’re honored to be a part of that, and we plan to be around for a long time.
