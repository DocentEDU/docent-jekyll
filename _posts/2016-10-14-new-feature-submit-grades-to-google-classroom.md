This wraps up our 3 part update to Google Classroom.

Here are a couple screenshots:

Select a class and a docent and that green button on the top right will appear. Click that and those grades will be sent to Google Classroom.

That's what things look like in Google Classroom once the grades get submitted.

And students will be able to see their grades without you having to take any other action in Classroom.
