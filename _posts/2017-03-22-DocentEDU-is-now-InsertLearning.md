Big news!

DocentEDU is now changing our name to InsertLearning!

This new name (along with a new logo) has been designed with our company’s main mission in mind: to allow teachers and students to insert learning anywhere on the web, be that learning questions, annotations, discussions, or interactive elements from your favorite web 2.0 apps. 

We want you to think of us, InsertLearning, as your “insert menu” that now follows you anywhere on the web. You now have the option, just as you do in word processors and slideshow creators among others, to click on the InsertLearning extension and insert almost anything when you are using your web browser. 

This change will soon be visible across all of our sites and social media. We are excited for this new name and redesign and look forward to continuing our work of making the process of planning and delivering great, online lessons easier for teachers and students.

We look forward to allow you to insert learning moments on the web with you and your students for years to come!

Matt, Ben, and Karin
