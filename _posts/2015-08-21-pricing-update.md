DocentEDU has been in beta for a little more than half a year, and we’ve been getting great feedback from our users. Co-founders Karin and Matt have been using DocentEDU in their own classes, and it’s been a transformative experience for them.

So far DocentEDU has been free to use. Starting September 1st we’ll be charging $40 per teacher per year. This includes all features and an unlimited number of docents, classes, and students.

We still want teachers to be able to try out DocentEDU before paying, so the first five docents are on us. During this time, teachers will still get access to every feature.

If you already have more than five docents, you can still fully access and assign all of your current docents without paying.

As always, if you have any questions or comments about this change, please reach out to us.
