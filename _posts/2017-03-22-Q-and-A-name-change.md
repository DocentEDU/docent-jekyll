DocentEDU is now InsertLearning. Here's what you need to know about the changes that come with it.

Q: Do I need to install a new extension?\s\s
A: No, your DocentEDU Chrome extension will automatically update to InsertLearning. You and your students may be asked to allow new permissions. If this happens you will need to allow the new permissions to use InsertLearning.

Q: Does my school tech department need to know about the change?\s\s
A: Possibly. Make sure that the website https://insertlearning.com is unblocked for teachers and students.
