  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>DocentEDU was created by teachers to solve one of the biggest problems they faced. Creating quality online assignments required too many steps and was still difficult to make sure students were understanding the information.</p>
  <p>The idea of having text, questions, discussions, and guidance as separate parts of a lesson was outdated and cumbersome. We needed a modern tool that let teachers guide students through online material just as if the teacher was sitting right next to the student. DocentEDU combines the essential ingredients of a good lesson in a natural and easy to use way never before possible.</p>
